Analysing and Visualizing the trends in Global Warming temperature rise based on greenhouse gases like CO2, N2O and CH4 and Predicting the 2 deg Celsius temperature rise.

Introduction
Global warming is one of the most pressing environmental issues of our time, driven primarily by the increase in greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O). These gases trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere, leading to a rise in global temperatures, which in turn causes significant climatic changes. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the global average temperature has already risen by approximately 1.1°C above pre-industrial levels. Understanding the trends in temperature rise and predicting future temperature scenarios is crucial for devising effective mitigation and adaptation strategies.

This project aims to analyze and visualize the trends in global warming by focusing on the contributions of CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, the project will predict when the global temperature is likely to breach the critical 2°C increase threshold above pre-industrial levels. This prediction is essential for policymakers and researchers to understand the urgency of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and to formulate strategies to combat climate change effectively.

The analysis will involve collecting historical data on greenhouse gas concentrations and global temperature changes. For instance, atmospheric CO2 levels have risen from 280 parts per million (ppm) in the pre-industrial era to over 410 ppm in recent years. Similarly, methane and nitrous oxide levels have increased significantly due to human activities such as agriculture, fossil fuel extraction, and industrial processes. The project will apply data visualization techniques to uncover patterns and trends and use predictive modeling to forecast future temperature rises. This comprehensive approach will provide valuable insights into the relationship between greenhouse gas emissions and global warming, highlighting the need for immediate and sustained action to protect our planet.
